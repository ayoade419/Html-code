Mr President is a welcoming person as you can see in the case of Chief Olabode George, who criticised the president for many years. Chief George said before the general elections that if Bola Tinubu becomes the President, he will relocate to Ghana. Today, he is still in Nigeria enjoying the dividends of democracy under the same President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</p>

	<p>“We are saying that Atiku, Peter Obi, and Kwankwaso are all welcome to be part of this administration. As all what we want is to ensure the success and progress of the Nigerian system which we believed is going to be obtainable under the President Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration.” </p>
